# ðŸš€ About Me
Salutations! My name is Chris "Futz" Gonzalez, but you can just call me Santi or Chris. I'm a somewhat recent Dickinson College grad, class of 2024 (Yikes! How fast times flies). I graduated my alma mater with a B.S in Computer Science and a B.A in Spanish Language and Literature. Back home in Maryland, I'm seeking opportunities to further my CS career. I've served as a web developer for [FarmData2](https://github.com/DickinsonCollege/FarmData2) and contributed to [Mermaid.js](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid). As a fan of Minecraft, I've also found myself contributing to Hardel's [NeoEnchant+](https://github.com/Hardel-DW/NeoEnchant). I'm currently looking to work on independent projects as my career journey continues.
